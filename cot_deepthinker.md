Dr. Emma Stein, a mathematical physicist, is studying heat conduction on a donut-shaped object called a torus. The torus has a major radius R and a minor radius r, where R > r > 0. She suspects that due to the material's complex microstructure, the heat conduction may exhibit anomalous diffusion, which can be modeled using a fractional differential equation.

The temperature distribution u(x, t) on the surface of the torus is governed by the following fractional partial differential equation:

∂ᵅu / ∂tᵅ + (-Δ)ˢ u = 0

where:

- x represents a point on the torus surface
- t is time
- α ∈ (0, 1) is the fractional order of the time derivative
- s ∈ (0, 1) is a spatial fractional parameter
- Δ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the torus

The initial condition is a prescribed temperature distribution u(x, 0) = f(x).

Dr. Stein wants to:

1. Prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to this fractional PDE
2. Investigate how the solution's regularity depends on the parameters α and s
3. Determine if the fractional nature of the equation leads to fundamentally different long-time behavior compared to the classical integer-order heat equation (α = 1, s = 1)
4. Understand the geometric effects: how does the torus shape (ratio R/r) influence the anomalous heat conduction?

To assist her, Dr. Stein hires you, a skilled graduate student in mathematical analysis. Your task is to develop a rigorous mathematical framework to address her questions. You will need to:

- Carefully define the appropriate function spaces and fractional Sobolev norms on the torus
- Derive the weak formulation of the fractional PDE using these function spaces
- Establish a priori estimates and use compactness arguments to prove existence of weak solutions
- Investigate higher regularity of solutions using bootstrapping techniques
- Construct explicit examples or numerical simulations to illustrate the long-time behavior and geometric effects
